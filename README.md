Raspberry-Pi-CPS-SN-trial
=========================

This is a raspbian image support CPS virtualize framework environment for implement sensor and actuator network flexible on the web. It is simple environment for education and non-profit objective embedded Linux kernel image. The image is trail and backup propuse. This framework is running well with Blue-sky cloud server. We will not responding anymore for the people who use this image with another ojective written above.

The framework shows that how we can implement the bridge framework about sensor and actuator network to flexible, robustness on the web.
